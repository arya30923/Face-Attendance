# Face-Attendance
This is a Real time Face Attendance System using dlib and numpy
The name of our Project is Face Attendance Recognition System. From the name itself our Project tells that it can solve our problem of Paper Attendance System in Colleges and Schools. Face detection and face recognition are very important technologies these days. We decided to make a Python implemented Code that detects and recognize the faces of the Student and make their attendance and can be a substitute for the regular paper attendance system. Our project is based on a main program in Face-Recognition Library in PyCharm that detects and recognize faces and make their Attendance with the current Date and Time and record it in the form of a CSV file.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118610521/224663107-01825a7b-0467-44f5-a3b9-7bd0f56e8129.png)
